A [Kakuro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro) solver written in Zig with a GUI for interactive solving.

For now, the solver uses an intentionally simple algorithm and focuses on an efficient implementation.

The repo bundles 950 Kakuro puzzles from [Otto and Angela Janko's puzzle site](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Kakuro/), an excellent resource for logic puzzles of all kinds. Currently, the zig-kakuro can solve 941 of 950 puzzles, or 99%. Of course, the goal is to reach 100% ðŸ˜Ž

## Building

1. Download Zig 0.9.1 for your platform [here](https://ziglang.org/download/).
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
1. In the repo folder, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
1. Run zig-kakuro in one of two ways:
  - Run `zig build gui` to run the GUI solver
  - Run `zig build solve` to run the solver on all the included Kakuros.

Although, zig-kakuro has been only tested on x86 MacOS, it _should_ build for Linux and Windows as well. If you run into any build problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/schmee/zig-kakuro/issues/new).
