A [Kakuro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro) solver written in Zig with a GUI for interactive solving.

The repo bundles 980 Kakuro puzzles from [Otto and Angela Janko's puzzle site](https://www.janko.at/Raetsel/Kakuro/), an excellent resource for logic puzzles of all kinds, and after some algorithm improvements zig-kakuro can now solve all 980 puzzles üòé
